# MacOSCreateOpenCommand
For a productivity improvement I like to open URLs from the command line or spotlight in the default browser.

This script creates a .command file placed in PATH and also uses a .aliasrc to add an alias for opening URLs from the command line.

e.g. createlink.sh appledev https://developers.apple.com

This creates a command file openappledev.command that can be used in spotlight.
